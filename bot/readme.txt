Place both the files (i.e main.exe and chromedrive.exe)on same directory.

Then run main.exe as administrator and follow the directions:
	input the link/links(comma sparated) in first textbox.
	input duration at which you want to take screenshot from each video
	input titles for every video in same sequence in which links were entered.
	Then wait for the execution. it'll open a prompt.

The apllication will take approx 45-50 seconds per video, depends on the internet and also on other factors.

The application will make another folder named pictures and will save all the pictures in it.

	If the folder named pictures is already there then it will show a dialogue that directory already exists simply click OK

A dialogur will appear on the main form after every iteration(creation of each picture) you need to click OK in order to preceed further.

Once all the links finished the application and prompt will get closed by itself and all the pictures will be saved

Iv'e tested this application multiple times and on other machines as well it is working absolutely fine hope it will satisfy you.

ALERT!!
you dont need to click anywherein the browser once the execution started

Thank you.
